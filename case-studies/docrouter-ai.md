## The Challenge

Organizations across industries like insurance, healthcare, finance, and supply chain struggle with processing unstructured documents such as faxes, emails, and forms. Manual data entry is time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. We wanted to build a scalable, AI-powered solution that integrates seamlessly with existing ERP systems.

The challenge was to build a robust platform from scratch that could handle document ingestion, classification, data extraction, human-in-the-loop review, and integrationâ€” all while ensuring high accuracy for regulated industries. With limited front-end experience, the development needed to be efficient and leverage cutting-edge AI tools to accelerate the process.

## The Solution

Analytiq Hub developed DocRouter.AI, an open-source document understanding tool available on GitHub, with SaaS and on-VPC deployment options. The platform transforms unstructured documents into structured data using large language models (LLMs), schema-driven prompts, and human oversight.

Key components of the solution include:
- **Document Ingestion:** Supports uploads from faxes, emails, and ERPs.
- **Configuration:** Users define versioned JSON schemas, customizable LLM prompts, and tags for data extraction.
- **AI-Powered Processing:** Utilizes OCR, LiteLLM for model orchestration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq/DeepSeek), and Python workers for scalable extraction.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Review:** Allows users to highlight, correct, and validate extractions in a user-friendly interface.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly routes structured data to existing ERPs and business processes.

The tech stack was chosen for simplicity and scalability:
- Frontend: React, TailwindCSS, Next.js, NextAuth.
- Backend: FastAPI, Pydantic.
- Database: MongoDB (with GridFS for blobs).
- Infrastructure: AWS via Terraform.
- Development Tools: Cursor (AI-powered text editor) and Claude Code for rapid prototyping and coding, enabling a single-developer build despite complex requirements.

To facilitate AI-assisted development, the FastAPI backend was structured in a single file for easier pattern recognition and editing by AI agents. This approach, combined with lessons from tools like Cursor and Claude, allowed for quick iterations and consistent code improvements.

DocRouter.AI acts as a horizontal AI accelerator, plugging into vertical-specific applications and reducing the need for custom development.

## Results

DocRouter.AI has achieved significant impact:
- Reduces processing time by up to 90% and eliminates costly errors by 95%.
- Delivers annual savings of over $50,000 per client through automation.
- Proven in pilots with insurance and supply chain organizations, handling use cases like claims processing, loan origination, patient records, manifests, and quiz grading.
- Open-source nature fosters community contributions, while SaaS (app.docrouter.ai) and enterprise deployments provide business value.
- Enables quick setup and customization, making it industry-agnostic yet precise for compliance-heavy workflows.
