For organizations across industries, we built DocRouter.AI - an intelligent document processing platform that transforms unstructured documents into structured data using AI and human-in-the-loop validation.

## The Challenge

Organizations across industries like insurance, healthcare, finance, and supply chain struggle with processing unstructured documents such as faxes, emails, and forms. Manual data entry is time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. The customer needed a scalable, AI-powered solution that integrates seamlessly with existing ERP systems while ensuring high accuracy for regulated industries.

## The Solution

We architected and implemented DocRouter.AI, establishing the foundation that enables AI-driven document processing to operate efficiently and reliably across multiple industries.

## Key Features

Our approach was designed to handle vast amounts of unstructured documents and to integrate seamlessly with existing business infrastructures. The design supported:
* Multi-format document ingestion (PDF, images, office documents via LibreOffice)
* AI-powered extraction using OCR and multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq/DeepSeek)
* Human-in-the-loop validation with highlighting, correction, and approval workflows
* Integration with existing ERPs and business processes through REST APIs and webhooks
* Visual workflow builder for custom processing pipelines

## How It Works
The system was built around several key components:

### Intelligent Document Ingestion & Processing {#intelligent-document-ingestion}

A critical first step is getting the right data in. We utilize **multi-format document upload** and **cloud storage** to process essential information such as:

- **Document Files** (drag-and-drop interface with batch processing)
- **Schema Definitions** (versioned JSON schemas for structured extraction)

All documents are then securely saved to **AWS S3**, processed with **AWS Textract OCR**, then with a suite of **Large Language Models** for intelligent analysis.

The system scales horizontally and handles thousands of documents per day with concurrent processing.

### A Multi-Faceted Tech Strategy {#tech-strategy}

To manage the diverse types of data involved, we designed a sophisticated tech stack:

- **MongoDB** is utilized for storing user data, document metadata, and processing results with flexible schema support
- **AWS S3** serves as the primary storage for document files and OCR outputs
- **Next.js 14** with TypeScript provides a modern, responsive frontend with Material-UI components
- **FastAPI** with async/await support handles backend API operations with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **LiteLLM** enables multi-provider LLM integration supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, and Mistral
- **Docker** containers with multi-stage builds provide consistent deployment across environments
- **AWS Lightsail** recommended deployment with Nginx reverse proxy and SSL certificates

### Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) {#leveraging-llms}

Our design harnesses the power of **multiple LLM providers** to perform critical extraction and decision-making tasks, with human oversight. LLMs are instrumental in:

- **Accurately extracting** structured data using JSON schema-guided prompts for consistent output formatting
- **Processing multiple document types** with configurable prompt templates and validation rules
- **Supporting various models** from different providers to optimize for cost, speed, and accuracy based on use case requirements

## Impact & The Future
DocRouter.AI has achieved significant impact with production deployments processing thousands of documents monthly. The platform reduces processing time by up to 90% and eliminates costly errors by 95%. The open-source foundation enables community contributions while SaaS and enterprise deployments provide scalable business value.
