I use MongoDB as the primary database for AI-powered products like [DocRouter.AI](https://docrouter.ai) and [SigAgent.AI](https://sigagent.ai). This post explains how it's implemented—migrations, vector search, and knowledge bases—and why I prefer it over alternatives like Postgres for document-centric, JSON-heavy AI workloads. I want to store a very large number of documents (DocRouter) or logs (SigAgent) without spending much time tuning the database for horizontal scaling; MongoDB fits that need well.

## Brief trade-offs vs Postgres

Postgres with **jsonb** can model the same document-style records and even integrate vector search via extensions, but it shines most when you need **strong relational guarantees** and **complex joins** around a relatively **stable schema**. MongoDB is a better fit when **almost everything is a JSON document**, the schema **evolves quickly**, and you care more about **horizontal scaling** and **quick turnaround** than about classic SQL features. 

In my case, the workloads are heavily document- and log-centric, so the ergonomics and scaling model of MongoDB outweigh the benefits of staying inside the relational/Postgres ecosystem.

## DocRouter and SigAgent: One Backend, Two Products

**DocRouter.AI** is a smart document router: you upload documents, define schemas and prompts, and it extracts structured data (e.g. from invoices, medical records, forms) using LLMs. **SigAgent** is a Claude agent monitor with a different UX and product focus, but it's built on the same stack.

Roughly **90% of the backend is shared**. Both use the same Python package, [analytiq_data](https://github.com/analytiq-hub/doc-router/tree/main/packages/python/analytiq_data): MongoDB client, migrations, queue layer, auth, and app startup. The same MongoDB database layout, indices, and migration history apply to both. Product-specific code lives in routes and frontends; the data layer is common.

## Strict Schema via Discipline: Migrations as "Schema"

MongoDB doesn't enforce a schema. I still want **predictable structure and safe upgrades**, so we enforce it in code and process:

- **Consistent document shape per collection.** We use a fixed set of field names and types in application code (and in TypeScript/Pydantic where applicable). In practice, each collection behaves like a table with a known "schema."
- **Every change goes through migrations.** Renaming fields, adding/removing fields, splitting or renaming collections—all of it is done in versioned migration classes with `up()` and `down()`. The current schema version is stored in a `migrations` collection; on startup we run `run_migrations(analytiq_client)` and bring the DB to the latest version.
- **Element types as schema.** We treat document fields as if they were typed: e.g. `schema_id`, `prompt_version`, `organization_id` are always present where we expect them. New code assumes the post-migration shape. So we get **comparable safety to Postgres** (known structure, no surprise shapes) while staying in a document model—as long as we're disciplined and never bypass migrations.

So: schema is "enforced" by convention and migrations, not by the database. That keeps development fast without giving up control.

## How Migrations and Indices Are Implemented

### Migrations

Migrations live in [migration.py](https://github.com/analytiq-hub/doc-router/blob/main/packages/python/analytiq_data/migrations/migration.py). Each migration is a class with:

- `description`: short human-readable summary
- `up(db)`: apply the change (e.g. rename field, backfill, add index)
- `down(db)`: revert the change when possible

The runner loads the list `MIGRATIONS`, assigns a version by index, and stores the current version in `db.migrations` under `_id: "schema_version"`. On startup we run pending migrations in order. Examples from the codebase:

- **Field renames:** e.g. `RenameUserFields` (camelCase → snake_case)
- **New fields:** e.g. `LlmResultFieldsMigration` (adds `is_edited`, `is_verified`, timestamps)
- **Structural changes:** e.g. `RenameCollections` (schemas → schema_revisions, schema_versions → schemas), `UseMongoObjectIDs`

Collection layout and index strategy evolve in one place, with a clear history and rollback path.

### Indices

We manage indices in two ways:

1. **Inside migrations** for long-term indices. These are created with `create_index(..., background=True)` and dropped in `down()` so rollback is consistent.
2. **At runtime** via `ensure_index()` in `analytiq_data/mongodb/index.py`. Given a collection, index spec, and name, it creates the index if missing (and optionally drops other non-`_id` indexes). We use this for things like `payments_usage_records (org_id, timestamp)` when the payments module initializes.

Example index patterns:

- **Queue collections:** `(status, created_at)` for `find_one_and_update({ status: "pending" }, sort: { created_at: 1 })`.
- **docs:** `(organization_id, upload_date desc)` for paginated listing by org.
- **llm_runs:** `(document_id, prompt_id, prompt_version desc)` for "latest run by document and prompt," and `(document_id, prompt_revid)` for exact revision lookup.
- **document_index:** unique `(kb_id, document_id)` and a non-unique `document_id` index for cascade deletes.

To find candidates for new indices, we use **Atlas Query Insights** (filter by operations returning >1,000 documents, then add a compound index matching the filter and sort) or, on **Community Edition**, enable the database profiler and filter `system.profile` by `nReturned`:

```javascript
db.setProfilingLevel(1, { slowms: 100 })
db.system.profile.find({ nReturned: { $gt: 1000 } }).sort({ ts: -1 }).limit(20)
```

Level 2 profiling captures everything but has I/O cost, so we use it in short bursts or staging. Level 1 (slow only) is cheaper and still surfaces most heavy queries.

With schema and indices in place, here's how we run it.

## Dev/Prod Setup and Vector Search

For **local development**, `MONGODB_URI` defaults to `mongodb://localhost:27017`. For vector search, we use the **MongoDB Atlas Local** Docker image (`mongodb/mongodb-atlas-local:latest`), which bundles `mongod` and **mongot** (the search/vector process) in one container.

For **production** we use **MongoDB Atlas**; for on-prem consulting we use **AWS DocumentDB**. The client is configured with `w='majority'`, `readPreference='secondaryPreferred'`, and `retryWrites=False` (DocumentDB doesn't support retryWrites).

For **self-hosted Community Edition**, vector search requires **MongoDB 8.2+** with **mongot** running alongside `mongod` in a replica set. The `createSearchIndexes` command and `$vectorSearch` aggregation work the same way across Atlas, Community 8.2+, and the local Docker image—no separate code path.

## Knowledge Bases on Top of Vector Search

We implement **knowledge bases** in the shared backend using MongoDB's vector search, with three key pieces: an indexing pipeline, a search pipeline, and a reconciliation service.

### Indexing: Blue-Green Atomic Swap

Each knowledge base gets its own vector collection (`kb_vectors_<kb_id>`). When a document is indexed, we chunk the text (via [Chonkie](https://github.com/chonkie-ai/chonkie): token/sentence/recursive chunkers), generate embeddings via LiteLLM, and then atomically swap old vectors for new ones inside a MongoDB transaction:

```python
async with await client.start_session() as session:
    async with session.start_transaction():
        # Delete old vectors for this document
        await vectors_collection.delete_many(
            {"document_id": document_id}, session=session
        )
        # Insert new vectors
        await vectors_collection.insert_many(new_vectors, session=session)
        # Update document_index entry
        await db.document_index.update_one(
            {"kb_id": kb_id, "document_id": document_id},
            {"$set": { ... }},
            upsert=True, session=session
        )
        # Update KB stats (document_count, chunk_count)
        await db.knowledge_bases.update_one(
            {"_id": ObjectId(kb_id)},
            {"$set": {"document_count": total_docs, "chunk_count": total_chunks}},
            session=session
        )
```

This blue-green pattern means a document is never in a half-indexed state: either all its new vectors are visible, or the old ones remain.

### Embedding Cache

Embeddings are cached in a global `embedding_cache` collection keyed by `(SHA-256 chunk hash, embedding model)`. When the same text chunk appears in multiple KBs (or is re-indexed after an edit), we skip the API call and reuse the cached vector. This saves both cost and latency—especially when re-indexing a large KB after a configuration change.

### Search

The query string is embedded with the same model, then we run an aggregation whose first stage is `$vectorSearch` (with `numCandidates = max(top_k * 10, 100)` for better recall). We apply filters (organization, tags, date range) in the vector index definition, add `vectorSearchScore` via `$meta`, and optionally coalesce neighboring chunks for richer context.

### Reconciliation: Keeping KBs in Sync

Documents and KBs can drift: a document's tags change, a document is deleted, or vectors are orphaned after a failed indexing run. The reconciliation service ([reconciliation.py](https://github.com/analytiq-hub/doc-router/blob/main/packages/python/analytiq_data/kb/reconciliation.py)) detects and fixes this:

- **Missing documents:** documents with matching tags but no `document_index` entry → queued for indexing.
- **Stale documents:** indexed documents whose tags no longer match the KB → removed.
- **Orphaned vectors:** vectors without a corresponding `document_index` entry → deleted.

Reconciliation uses a **distributed lock** (atomic `find_one_and_update` with a 10-minute TTL) so only one worker reconciles a given KB at a time. It processes documents in batches of 100 to keep memory bounded, and supports **dry-run mode** for auditing without side effects.

In short: we get **strict schema via migrations**, **predictable indexing**, **vector search for RAG with atomic updates**, and **self-healing knowledge bases**—with one backend shared between DocRouter and SigAgent, and the same patterns whether we run on local Mongo, Atlas, or DocumentDB.
