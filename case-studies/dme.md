                At a stealth startup, we're building intelligent systems to streamline complex healthcare processes, particularly in areas like Medical Necessity Review. My work with Ashvin has involved significant contributions to the core system design, establishing the foundational architecture that enables our AI-driven solutions to operate efficiently and reliably.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Our approach to medical necessity review at a system level is a comprehensive one, designed to handle vast amounts of data and integrate seamlessly with existing healthcare infrastructures. Drawing insights from our detailed feature specifications, the online system is built around several key components:
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Intelligent Data Ingestion & Processing</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
                A critical first step is getting the right data in. We utilize Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and APIs to connect to customer ERP systems and fax portals. This allows us to extract essential information such as Fax PDFs (in near real-time), and patient and order databases (daily). All documents are then securely saved to S3 and processed with Optical Character Recognition (OCR), laying the groundwork for further intelligent analysis.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Power of the Event Loop</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
                At the heart of our system is a robust event loop. This component is responsible for dispatching operations and implementing the intricate business logic required for medical necessity review. It acts as the orchestrator, ensuring that data flows correctly through various processing stages.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">A Multi-Faceted Database Strategy</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
                To manage the diverse types of data involved, we employ a sophisticated database storage strategy:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-8 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li><strong>S3</strong> is used for storing raw PDFs, OCR output, and image files.</li>
                <li><strong>Postgres</strong> serves as the UI backend, providing a reliable and structured data store for our user interfaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Databricks</strong> is leveraged for big data batch processing and analytics, enabling advanced machine learning capabilities and, in the future, supporting Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) KPIs.</li>
                <li><strong>MongoDB</strong> is utilized for storing pipeline output, providing flexibility for semi-structured data from our processing workflows.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs)</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Our system harnesses the power of LLMs to perform critical extraction and decision-making tasks. LLMs are instrumental in accurately extracting patient names, dates of birth, doctor names/NPIs, and order information directly from documents. Furthermore, they play a crucial role in driving specific aspects of the business logic, making our system highly intelligent and adaptable.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Looking Ahead: Refining Intelligence and Integration</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
                As with any cutting-edge system, we're continuously evolving. Key areas of ongoing development and refinement include:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-8 space-y-2 text-lg">
                <li>Determining the optimal balance for business logic residency—whether it primarily resides within LLMs or is distributed between LLMs and the Event Loop.</li>
                <li>Strategizing the implementation of LLM prompts—whether they are embedded inline or managed within a dedicated LLM prompt library.</li>
                <li>Exploring the best approaches for LLM orchestration.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Through this carefully designed and continuously refined architecture, Ashvin AI is empowering healthcare organizations to achieve greater efficiency, accuracy, and compliance in their operations. It's an exciting time to be at the forefront of healthcare technology, and I'm proud to contribute to building these transformative solutions.
